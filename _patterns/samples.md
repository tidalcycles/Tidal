All the samples can be found in the `samples` subfolder of the Dirt
distribution.  Here's some you could try:

    flick sid can metal future gabba sn mouth co gretsch mt arp h cp
    cr newnotes bass crow hc tabla bass0 hh bass1 bass2 oc bass3 ho
    odx diphone2 house off ht tink perc bd industrial pluck trump
    printshort jazz voodoo birds3 procshort blip drum jvbass psr
    wobble drumtraks koy rave bottle kurt latibro rm sax lighter lt
    arpy feel less stab ul

Each one is a folder containing one or more wav files. For example
when you put `bd:1` in a sequence, you're picking up the second wav
file in the `bd` folder. If you ask for the ninth sample and there are
only seven in the folder, it'll wrap around and play the second one.

If you want to add your own samples, just create a new folder in the
samples director, and put `wav` files in it.
