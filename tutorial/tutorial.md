% Tidal tutorial

Welcome to the Tidal tutorial. Tidal is a mini-language for exploring pattern, designed for use in live coding performance. In this tutorial we'll step through different levels of abstraction, starting with sounds and filters, then sequences of sounds and filters, and moving up to functions for manipulating those sequences, and ending up looking at functions which manipulate other functions. Fun stuff!

# Sounds and filters

With a bit of fiddling, Tidal can be used to pattern the input to any
device which takes MIDI or Open Sound Control input, but the default is the Dirt software sampler.

```haskell

```

# Sequences

You can get a long way with working with

# Functions

# Meta-functions
