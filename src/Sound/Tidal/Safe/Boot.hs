--  Resets the cycle count back to 0.
--  Useful to make sure a pattern or set of patterns start from the beginning:
--
--  > do
--  >   resetCycles
--  >   d1 $ s "bd hh hh hh"
--  >   d2 $ s "ade" # cut 1
--
--  Cycle count affects all patterns, so if there are any active, all of them will immediately jump to the beginning.
--  @resetCycles@ is also userful in multi-user Tidal.

--  Also see 'setCycle', 'getnow'.

--  Adjusts the number of cycles per second, i.e., tempo.
--  Accepts integers, decimals, and fractions.
--
--  The default number of cycles per second is 0.5625, equivalent to 135\/60\/4, i.e.,
--  135 beats per minute if there are 4 beats per cycle.
--
--  Representing cycles per second using fractions has the advantage of being more
--  human-readable and more closely aligned with how tempo is commonly represented
--  in music as beats per minute (bpm). For example, techno has a typical range of
--  120-140 bpm and house has a range of 115-130 bpm. To set the tempo in Tidal to
--  fast house, e.g.,: @setcps (130\/60\/4)@.

--  The following sound the same:
--
--  > setcps (130/60/4)
--  > d1 $ n "1" # s "kick kick kick kick"
--
--  and
--
--  > setcps (130/60/1)
--  > d1 $ n "1" # s "kick"
